# Welcome to my CS 300 portfolio!

This repository contains my coursework and projects from the CS 300: Analysis and Design class.

## About This Course
CS 300 focuses on software analysis, design principles, and object-oriented programming practices. Throughout the course, I have completed assignments, labs, and projects to develop skills in designing efficient, maintainable, and scalable software systems.

---

## Repository Contents
- **Assignments:** Exercises and tasks covering data structures, design patterns, UML diagrams, and software evaluation.  
- **Lab Activities:** Hands-on labs that reinforce object-oriented design, software architecture, and algorithm implementation.  
- **Projects:** Larger projects demonstrating practical application of analysis and design concepts, including UML modeling, pseudocode development, and system evaluation.

## Reflection
### Transferable Skills
This course helped me strengthen my problem-solving, critical thinking, and system design skills. I learned to analyze software requirements, create structured designs, and apply object-oriented principles in practical projects. These skills are applicable to almost any software development project.

### Code Maintainability and Readability
I focused on writing clean, organized code and design documentation that others can easily understand. Using consistent formatting, clear naming conventions, and well-documented classes and functions helps ensure maintainability and future scalability.

This portfolio showcases my progress and learning in CS 300: Analysis and Design. I will update it with project-specific reflections and documentation as I complete each assignment and project.
